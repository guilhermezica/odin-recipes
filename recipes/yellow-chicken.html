<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>⅔ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons liquid smoke flavoring</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix olive oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, 
            liquid smoke, mustard, pepper, and garlic powder together in a large glass or 
            ceramic bowl.</li>
        <li>Place chicken in the bowl and turn to coat with marinade. Cover and marinate in the
             refrigerator for 1 to 4 hours. For best results, do not marinate longer than 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read 
            thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
